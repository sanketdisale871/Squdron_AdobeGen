<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ‚ôæÔ∏è About The Project

This project focuses on the optimization of polyline shapes extracted from a set of 2D coordinates, representing various geometrical figures such as lines, circles, and rectangles. The primary goal is to accurately identify and simplify these shapes, reducing their complexity while preserving their fundamental characteristics. By implementing advanced detection algorithms, the code efficiently determines whether a polyline corresponds to a straight line, a circular arc, or a rectangular shape, and then simplifies it accordingly.

The project utilizes a combination of mathematical techniques, including Convex Hull analysis, RANSAC for circle detection, and relaxed geometric checks for rectangle identification. These methods allow the code to handle imperfections often found in hand-drawn shapes, making it robust against noisy or irregular input data. Additionally, the code can merge overlapping circles, further simplifying the representation of the input shapes.

One of the key features of this project is its flexibility in handling real-world data, where perfect geometric figures are rare. The detection algorithms have been designed with tolerances that account for deviations from ideal shapes, ensuring that even imperfect figures are correctly identified and optimized. This makes the project particularly useful for applications in computer vision, shape recognition, and data visualization.

The code is well-structured, with functions dedicated to specific tasks such as loading data, optimizing polylines, and visualizing the results. The use of Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scipy ensures that the project is both powerful and easy to extend. Whether used for academic research or practical applications, this project provides a solid foundation for shape optimization and detection in 2D space.
